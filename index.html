    <h1> A Primer to New York State's Gun Law </h1>

    <p> Applicants for concealed carry licenses are required to provide to gun licensing officers a list of their current and former social media accounts from the past three years to assess if the applicant has “the essential character, temperament and judgment necessary to be entrusted with a weapon and to use it only in a manner that does not endanger oneself or others.” Other requirements include applicants providing the names and contact information of those who reside in their home and four character references “who can attest to the applicant's good moral character.” </p>

    <p> Under the law, persons are prohibited from carrying concealed firearms in areas throughout the state designated as a “sensitive location.” These areas include New York City’s Times Square, churches, schools, public parks and playgrounds, areas for public transportation, hospitals, government buildings, and other locations. Exemptions are made for police officers and other applicable law enforcement officials.</p>

    <p> Applicants applying for a new conceal carry license or seeking to renew their license are now required to undergo a minimum of 16 hours of in-person gun training that addresses, among other matters, firearm safety, how to safely store a firearm, New York state and federal gun laws and conflict de-escalation. Applicants are also required to complete a minimum of two-hours of a live-fire gun range course. </p>

    <p> The law mandates the creation of a statewide license and records database for ammunition sales to allow law enforcement officials to better regulate and track the sale of ammunition throughout the state. Additionally, ammo and firearms sellers are now required to keep an electronic record of all of their transactions, rather than a record book. </p>
